* ~~Adding larger IEEE cases (IEEE14, IEEE57) ~~
* Adding large scale test cases (national and panEuropean ones): postponed to June 2020
* ~~Adding new models (proportional and proportional integral VR, proportional governor, static var compensator, PLL, injectors) ~~
* PV WECC model: under progress, expected February 2020
* Grid forming converters models: under progress, expected March 2020
* Nordic32 case: expected June 2020
* Wind WECC model: expected July 2020
* HVDC standard model: expected September 2020

### Axis 2 - Dependencies upgrade and cross-platform deployment
