#### OpenModelica workshop

Two presentations related to the use of Modelica for power system simulations were done during the last [OpenModelica workshop](https://openmodelica.org/events/openmodelica-workshop/openmodelica-program-2021).

* **[A presentation](https://openmodelica.org/images/M_images/OpenModelicaWorkshop_2021/1010_Dynawo%20-%20A%20Suite%20of%20Power%20System%20Simulation%20Tools%20using%20Modelica%20and%20the%20Open%20Modelica%20Compiler.pdf) on Dyna&omega;o** introducing the main motivations related to the project, its history and its perspectives as well as the links it has with Modelica and in particular the OpenModelica Compiler.

* **[A presentation](https://openmodelica.org/images/M_images/OpenModelicaWorkshop_2021/1530_ScalableTestGridsPresentation.pdf) with Dynamica of the [ScalableTestGrids library](https://github.com/PowerGrids/ScalableTestGrids)**, an open-source Modelica library created to generate power system large-scale test cases to assess Modelica tools performance.

#### IEEE PES General Meeting presentation

A presentation on the Dyna&omega;o approach is scheduled at the next IEEE PES General Meeting conference, that will be held virtually during August 2020. The presentation is included into a very nice panel session on "Numerical challenges in multi-energy simulations" and is entitled **"Speed-up of Modelica based large-scale simulations, the example of the open-source tool Dyna&omega;o".** It explains the main principles of the approach before going into more details on the advanced strategies used in Dyna&omega;o to reach performances compatible with an industrial use. **If you have registered for the conference, the presentation is available [here](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/console/EventConsoleApollo.jsp?uimode=nextgeneration&eventid=2462049&sessionid=1&key=98CD1C81776A198D3BF0C7A11E3852EC&contenttype=A&eventuserid=305999&playerwidth=1000&playerheight=650&caller=previewLobby&text_language_id=en&format=fhvideo1&newConsole=true#).**

#### Dyna&omega;o becomes a suite of simulation tools

**Dyna&omega;o 's primary focus has been on long-term and short-term stability studies** but the very encouraging results obtained and the flexibility of the approach led to **an extension of the initiative. Dyna&omega;o  is now evolving towards a complete and coherent suite of simulation tools**, sharing the same philosophy:
  - **[DynaFlow]({{ '/about/dynaflow' }})** for steady-state calculations
  - **[DySym]({{ '/about/dysym' }})** for short-circuit calculations
  - **[DynaWaltz]({{ '/about/dynawaltz' }})** for long-term stability simulations
  - **[DynaSwing]({{ '/about/dynaswing' }})** for short-term stability studies
  - **[DynaWave]({{ '/about/dynawave' }})** for stability studies and system design with a high-penetration of power-electronics based components (quasi-EMT)
