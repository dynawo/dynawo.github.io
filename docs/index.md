The documentation explains how to install Dyna&omega;o and its companion projects, how to configure it to simulate a given test case, gives more details on the models library and the solvers included into the simulation tool and introduces more advanced features such as adding a new Modelica model to the library.

For the moment, the documentations are available only as PDF files.
