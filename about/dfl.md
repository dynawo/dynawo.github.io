Dynaflow-launcher is a utility tool used to easily run [DynaFlow]({{ '/about/dynaflow' }}) starting from a minimal set of inputs.

It provides the following possibilities:
  - **Unitary simulations**: computation of the steady-state solution on a given network (IIDM format) with Dynaflow
  - **Systematic analysis**: assessment of the stability of a single base network subject to different events

More information is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher) or in the [Dynaflow-launcher documentation](https://github.com/dynawo/dynaflow-launcher/releases/download/v1.5.0/DynaflowLauncherDocumentation.pdf).
